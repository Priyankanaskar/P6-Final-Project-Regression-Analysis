## 📁 Project Overview

This project applies regression analysis to predict **medical insurance charges** based on user attributes such as age, BMI, and smoking status using Python and scikit-learn.

The goal is to:
- Understand the relationships between personal health attributes and insurance cost.
- Train and evaluate linear regression models and advanced pipelines.
- Use exploratory data analysis (EDA) to inform feature selection and improve model performance.
